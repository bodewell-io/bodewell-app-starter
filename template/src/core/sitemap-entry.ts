/**
 * @file sitemap-entry.ts
 * @repository bodewell-app-starter
 * @description This file defines the canonical TypeScript interface for a single
 * sitemap entry. It is the "schema" or "contract" that governs the entire
 * Sitemap-Driven Architecture.
 *
 * STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE:
 * 1. Designer DX: It provides strict type-safety and autocompletion for any
 * designer editing a `sitemap.ts` file, dramatically lowering the risk of errors.
 * 2. Repo-Linking: It directly imports `IconName` from `@bodewell/ui`, creating
 * a type-safe link between our starter kit and our component library.
 * 3. AI-Ready: This interface is the precise data structure that the AI Assistant
 * in the (private) `bodewell-app-builder` will be trained to generate.
 * The "Architect" phase of the A.D.A.P.T. Framework will result in the
 * AI creating an array of these objects.
