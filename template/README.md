# Bodewell App Starter

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository is the official starter kit for building applications with the **Bodewell UI** component library. It provides the ideal local environment for designers and developers to rapidly build, test, and validate high-fidelity, interactive prototypes.

The starter kit comes pre-configured with a modern frontend stack to ensure a smooth development experience, allowing you to focus on building your application instead of on project setup.

---

## Getting Started

To create a new project using this starter kit, run the following command in your terminal. This will scaffold a new application in a directory of your choice. "your-project-name" should be customized for your new directory.

```bash
npm create bodewell-app@latest your-project-name
```

This single command will:

- Create a new project folder.

- Install all necessary dependencies, including React, Vite, and @bodewell/ui.

- Set up the recommended folder structure and configuration files.

After the installation is complete: 

# 1. Navigate into your new project

```bash
cd your-project-name
```
# 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```
# 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your new Bodewell application will be running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## The Bodewell Ecosystem
The Bodewell project is an integrated framework architected across three separate repositories:

* `@bodewell/ui` A public, open-source component library distributed as an NPM package.

* `bodewell-app-starter` (This Repository): A public, open-source starter-kit application that provides the ideal local environment for building with Bodewell.
