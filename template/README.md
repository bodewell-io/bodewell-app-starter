# Bodewell App Starter

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository is the official starter kit for building applications with the **Bodewell UI** component library. It provides the ideal local environment for designers and developers to rapidly build, test, and validate high-fidelity, interactive prototypes.

The starter kit comes pre-configured with a modern frontend stack to ensure a smooth development experience, allowing you to focus on building your application instead of on project setup.

---

## Getting Started

To create a new project using this starter kit, run the following command in your terminal. This will scaffold a new application in a directory of your choice.

```bash
npm create bodewell-app@latest
```

This single command will:

1. Create a new project folder.

2. Install all necessary dependencies, including React, Vite, and @bodewell/ui.

3. Set up the recommended folder structure and configuration files.

After the installation is complete, navigate into your new project directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd <your-project-name>
npm run dev
```

Your new Bodewell application will be running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

This starter kit is built on a modern, performant tech stack:

* **Vite:** A next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development server and build process.

* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds type safety to your code.

## The Bodewell Ecosystem
The Bodewell project is an integrated framework architected across three separate repositories:

* `@bodewell/ui` A public, open-source component library distributed as an NPM package.

* `bodewell-app-starter` (This Repository): A public, open-source starter-kit application that provides the ideal local environment for building with Bodewell.

* `bodewell-app-builder` A hosted SaaS application featuring our AI Prototyping Assistant, which guides users through the strategic A.D.A.P.T. Framework to build applications from a solid strategic foundation.
